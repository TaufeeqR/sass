#SASS
Introduction into Sass

Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets using concepts like variables, mixins, and nesting into the CSS code we have already learnt. Sass boasts more features and abilities than any other CSS extension language out there. 

#SASS PARTIALS
Sass Partials are files that contain little pieces of CSS which helps you modularize your CSS and makes things esier to maintain. A partial is a SASS file named with a leading underscore. The underscore tells SASS that is a partial file and should not be generated as a CSS file. They let you split your stylesheet into seperate files. Each partial is a file that makes a piece of a css puzzle.

#SASS VARIABLES
Variables allow us to store things such as colors, font stacks, or any CSS value that we think we might re-use using the $ symbol.

#MIXINS
Mixins are one of the most used features of SASS. They let you break down CSS down into modular chunks that you can reuse anywhere in your stylesheet. Being able to do this helps us to avoid writing repetitive code.
